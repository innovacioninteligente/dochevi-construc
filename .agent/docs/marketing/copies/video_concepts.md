## 🏗️ Concept 1: "The Silent Partner" (Focus: Peace of Mind)
**Hook:** Ideally, a construction site is noisy, but your office should be quiet. Why isn't it? (Visual: Chaos of Excel, lost paperwork).
**Solution:** Dochevi acts as your silent, intelligent partner. It organizes the chaos before it starts.
**Key Visual:** A frantic desk vs. a calm Dochevi dashboard.
**Customization Angle:** "It learns *your* way of working, so you don't have to change yours."
**Ending:** "Build with clarity."

## 🚀 Concept 2: "The 10-Minute Bid" (Focus: Speed & Competitive Edge)
**Hook:** You lose 80% of the jobs you quote. Why? Because you're too slow or too expensive (safety margins).
**Solution:** Quote in minutes, not days. With AI precision.
**Key Visual:** Speed-run of the "Wizard" generating a full budget from a simple WhatsApp audio.
**Execution Angle:** "Win the job on Monday, start confidently on Tuesday." (Certainty leads to execution).
**Ending:** "Win more jobs, faster."

## 🔄 Concept 3: "From Sketch to Site" (Focus: The Workflow)
**Hook:** The gap between what the client wants and what you build is where profit dies.
**Solution:** A seamless flow. The budget *is* the plan.
**Customization Angle:** "Adapt every line item, margin, and material to *your* reality."
**Execution Feature:** Show how the budget becomes the project roadmap (Phases/Progress).
**Ending:** "Control from click to brick."

### ❓ Clarification on "Execution"
The codebase currently has strong **Budgeting** (Smart RAG, decomposition) and basic **Project Phases** (progress tracking).
Do we have deeper execution features (Certifications, Daily Logs) ready to show, or should we frame "Execution" as "The budget is so good, execution is made easy"? This affects the script's promise.
